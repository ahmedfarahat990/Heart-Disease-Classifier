# ❤️ Heart Disease Classifier

Predict heart disease with confidence using cutting-edge machine learning! 🚀

This project empowers healthcare professionals, data scientists, and enthusiasts to detect heart disease from clinical data using three state-of-the-art models:

- **Logistic Regression** — Fast, interpretable, and reliable
- **Deep Neural Network (Keras)** — Powerful, flexible, and scalable
- **XGBoost Classifier** — Industry-leading accuracy and feature importance

✔️ Visualize results with beautiful confusion matrices and performance metrics
✔️ Compare models side-by-side for actionable insights
✔️ Ready-to-use notebook for experimentation and learning

> **Transform data into life-saving predictions. Join the mission to fight heart disease with AI!**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Every model is rigorously evaluated with:

- **Accuracy** — How often predictions are correct
- **Classification Report** — Precision, Recall, F1-Score for deeper insight
- **Confusion Matrix** — Visual breakdown of true/false predictions
- **Mean Squared Error** — Compare model loss for optimization
